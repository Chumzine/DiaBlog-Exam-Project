                <p>DiaBlog is an online space where you get to share things about your life, 
                    more like a diary but a public one. Do I hear you say, "How can I share my 
                    private and intimate things?" Fret not, because it doesn't hasve to be that 
                    private, just things about you that you will normally share on social media 
                    or tell friends.</p>
                <p>With DiaBlog, you don't have to lug about a conventional diary and pen. 
                    You can document your life in a blog. So welcome to the world of blogging. 
                    You get to be a lifestyle blogger and share your life's stories with a community. </p>
                <p>DiaBlog is created by Adaobi Chuma-Okeke, a Backend Engineering student of 
                    <a href="https://thealtschool.com/">AltSchool Africa</a>, using the 
                    HTML and CSS markup languages, and the Python programming language 
                    with Flask framework.
